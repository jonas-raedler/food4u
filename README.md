As home cooks, we realized that we often face the problem of opening our fridge, seeing the ingredients available to us, but then not knowing what meal to cook with what we have (or that we tend to always cook the same thing). Thus, we came up with the idea of creating an application that could, based on some list of ingredients, output a list of recipes that could be cooked with these ingredients. On top of that, if certain ingredients are missing, the application could, based on the user’s location and the grocery stores in that area, calculate the price per store for the missing ingredients and recommend the best one to shop at so that the user can choose the store that offers the cheapest price for the desired ingredients. 
While this is the main idea, there are a lot of additional features for this application that we thought of, such as outputting the nutritional values of a recipe, having a “What are your friends cooking?” system (similar to Spotify’s), being able to create a “What do I cook this week?” planner, which then gives the user a shopping list for all the necessary ingredients, and filtering for recipes not only by ingredients, but also by whether the ingredients it uses are seasonal or not, and by what type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) the user would like to cook.
All in all, the application would aim to make the process of figuring out what to cook and of getting the necessary ingredients - in other words, the less fun aspects of cooking - easier.
